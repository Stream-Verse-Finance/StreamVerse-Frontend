# 🚀 StreamVerse: The Next-Gen Interactive Streaming Game Hub

**StreamVerse** is a comprehensive Web2.5 platform that bridges the gap between Viewers, Streamers, and Game Developers. We build an ecosystem where digital assets (NFTs) are not just collectibles—they possess real-world liquidity and cross-game interoperability.

---

## 🌟 Project Vision
StreamVerse aims to eliminate the friction between Web2 and Web3. We transform every Livestream interaction into an economic action while providing a robust infrastructure (Liquidity & SDK) that allows indie startups and developers to scale and share revenue.

## 🛠 Core Features

### 1. Unified Authentication & Smart Wallet
* **Hybrid Login:** Seamless onboarding via Google, Facebook (Social Login), and Web3 wallets (Phantom, Metamask).
* **Account Abstraction (AA):** Automated creation of Smart Contract Wallets for Web2 users, removing the complexity of seed phrases.
* **Gasless Experience:** Integrated **Paymaster** to subsidize transaction fees, ensuring a smooth UX where users don't need to hold native tokens (SOL/ETH).

### 2. NFT System & Permanent Liquidity
* **On-chain Metadata:** Immutable storage of attributes and effect stats on the blockchain.
* **System Vault (Stable Liquidity):** A "Buy-back" mechanism that guarantees a floor price (e.g., $50 buy-back for a $60 NFT), ensuring users always have an exit strategy.
* **Proof of Interaction:** An anti-arbitrage system that grants full liquidity rights only to NFTs with a verified history of Livestream interaction.

### 3. StreamVerse SDK (For Developers)
* **Standardized Logic:** Share Effect IDs through the SDK, allowing external games to read and implement NFT skills consistently.
* **Revenue Autopilot:** Automated distribution of service fees and royalty commissions at the moment of transaction via Smart Contracts.
